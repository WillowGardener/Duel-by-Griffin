this is a simple game that allows two people to fight to the death--for pretend!

Currently this game is very much in an alpha state. Initially
it was intended to include multiple classes, but only one
ended up being necessary. I will later add classes for extra
monsters, etc if I continue working on the game.

Balance issues at present: block is underpowered, parry is
overpowered.

Currently the best strategy is always just to use parry
three or four times, then heavy strike until you win.

This also contains the unused "mana" attribute, intended to
add a layer of additional complexity. I will add mana costs
later as well.

Finally, I would like to add functionality for randomization
of stats for a new challenge each time, as well as the choice
of which move loadout to use.
