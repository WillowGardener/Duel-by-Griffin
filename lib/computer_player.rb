require "player"

# In my initial design, I thought I would need
# a separate class for computer player. Then I realized I only needed
# about five lines of code. Whoops... not sure what need this program
# would have for a second class, although I could design multiple
# types of opponents; I made do this as I work on the program more,
# but for now I've worked on this too much for an assessment already
